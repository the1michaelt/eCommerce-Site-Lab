e-Commerce Site Lab

The Cara Cara website was given as an example to emulate in two forms: as a wireframe and as a one pager. 

This was my first time using AdobeXD for wireframing. 
This was my first time using CSS Flexbox to style a page. 
My goal was to produce a close replica of the original with both the wireframe and the single page product.
 
How did I do? See for yourself.
